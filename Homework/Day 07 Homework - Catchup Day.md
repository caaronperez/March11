# Day 07 Homework - Catchup Day

## Closures

* <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html">Apple Docs on Swift 5 for Closures</a>
	* Read this. If there are words or concepts you don't understand, write them down. 
	* Do just like we all did in grade school. Infer meaning from context. 
	* After your first read through, you should have a list of things you don't understand. Try and prioritize them from what you think is most important to least important, in order to understand the whole page. Start at the top (highest priority) and start looking up concepts. 
	* You probably want to save these terms. Make your own glossary. Just like we all did in gradeschool. 
	* You'll need to know (most of) these terms for interviews. It doesn't really matter if you know the concept, if you can't remember the key words that are associated with a given concept.
	* Seriously ppl. Closures are important.

* Do it

## Other trouble topics
* Look back over the syllabus
* Take note of any unfamiliar concepts, anything that needs more clarification that you have been unable to find on your own
* Take a stab at solving these knowledge defficiencies on your own first, if you can't figure out a resource that suits your learning style, keep it on your list and we'll work it into class when we are able

## You best be spending at least 4 hours on this. Thats the minimum. I expect a good list of unfamiliar concepts and a good amount of answers.
