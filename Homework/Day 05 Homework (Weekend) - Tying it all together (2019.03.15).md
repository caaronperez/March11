## Apple Food Tracker Tutorial

## Good to Know Things

* You may notice that you do things as instructed, and it gives you an error, or a warning. This is because this tutorial was written for Xcode 8.1, iOS SDK 10, and Swift 3. So, its a little outdated. Thats OK. 
* You can ignore warnings that something is deprecated.
* If it will not compile and run on the simulator, then do some troubleshooting. Google the exact error. 
* If you still can't figure it out, ask your class mates. 
* If no one can figure it out, ask me. There better not be anyone who shows up to class without completing the assignment if they didn't use all their resources (Internet, classmates, instructors, etc.)
* This is a complex project. I'd reccomend after each stage, for you to save your work by zipping up a copy of your current code. I'd label it with the date and time so its easy to see where to go back to if you mess up and can't figure out where you messed up. 
* I'm going to say it again. Save your work periodically. Every time you complete a feature. Save it. Save it. Save it. This will save you hours of frustration.

## If You Get Stuck

* Google it
* Read the documentation
