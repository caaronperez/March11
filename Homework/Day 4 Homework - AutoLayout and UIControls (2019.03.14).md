# Day 4 Homework - AutoLayout and UIControls

## Tutorials 

* <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/443-auto-layout-tutorial-in-ios-11-getting-started">AutoLayout</a>
* <a href="https://codewithchris.com/xcode-tutorial/">XcðŸ˜­de IDE Basics</a>

## UI Elements
* Add one or more of each element to a View Controller in a Storyboard
	* UILabel
	* UIImage
	* UIButton
	* UISegmentedControl
	* UITextField
	* UISlider
	* UISwitch
* Each element should be constrained correctly
* Hook them up in a way so the user can change them somehow. 
	* Ex. a button could change text on a label
	* Ex. a slider could change the Alpha (transparency) on a text field
	* Ex. a switch could change if an image is hidden
	* Ex. a segmented control could change text
* Each Item that CAN have an action MUST have an action that we can visibly see
* Each item that CANNOT have an action MUST be visibly changed by an item that has an action
* In short, each item should either change something, or be changed by something.

## If You Get Stuck
* Google it
	* "Swift how to use a UILabel"
	* "swift how to add ibaction to button"
	* "How to set text on UILabel programatically"
* Read the documentation 
	* Google "<ElementName> documentation"
	* Option Click on the class name to bring up documentation
