# Day 10 Homework - (Weekend) Study what you struggled with

## What to study

* What did you do poorly on or struggle with on the test?
* Study those things

## Do the test 2-3 more times

* After you have a chance to study on what was difficult, do the test a few more times
* You will be asked to preform this basic test, but with more complexity, in interviews, in far less time. 
	* An interviewer would typically expect this to be completed in 30-60 minutes
	* you'll have to do it live, while screen sharing, and not using any other resources
	* practice practice practice
* I should be able to see improvements from version to version of your test. Study up in between doing it.
* Upload it, as always, to github
